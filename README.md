## 📌 𝗔𝗯𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗥𝗲𝗽𝗼

This repository documents my hands-on Machine Learning journey through **experiments and implementations**, not just theory.

Each concept is:

✔ implemented from scratch
✔ tested on real or synthetic datasets
✔ evaluated with metrics
✔ visualized with plots
✔ summarized with insights

The goal is to build **strong intuition through practice** and create a structured portfolio of ML work.

## 🧠 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗮𝗰𝗵

For every algorithm, I follow:

1. Understand theory
2. Implement model
3. Train & evaluate
4. Visualize behavior
5. Analyze mistakes
6. Document learnings

Because real ML skill comes from experimentation, not memorization.
